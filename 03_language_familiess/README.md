# Language Families

This project is a simple model of language families implemented using object-oriented programming concepts.
It demonstrates how inheritance and polymorphism can represent the hierarchical relationships between:

* Language families (e.g. Indo-European)
* Subfamilies (e.g. Germanic)
* Individual languages (e.g. English, Swedish)

The project was created only for practicing OOP principles and is not intended for further development.

## Skills practiced

* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## How to Run

This is a console-based demo project.
Simply run the `main` file to see example output.

## Purpose

The main goal is to strengthen understanding of **OOP inheritance** and **polymorphism** by applying them to a clear real-world hierarchy.
