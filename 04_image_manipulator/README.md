# ðŸ–¼ Image Manipulator

A simple Java console application that allows you to apply basic transformations to images represented as two-dimensional matrices of numbers.

Image Manipulator provides 6 different modes:

- **Invert Colors** â€“ inverts all pixel values to create a negative effect.
- **Adjust Brightness** â€“ increases or decreases image brightness by a given value.
- **Rotate Image** â€“ rotates the image by 90Â°, 180Â°, or 270Â° clockwise.
- **Flip Image** â€“ flips the image horizontally or vertically.
- **Blur Image** â€“ applies a simple blur effect by averaging the values of each pixel and its neighbors.
- **Display Image** â€“ prints the image matrix to the console.

## â–¶ Usage:
Compile and run the project:

```bash
javac Main.java ImageUtils.java InputHandler.java
java Main
```

Follow on-screen instruction to choose an operation and provide necessary input.
