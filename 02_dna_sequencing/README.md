# ðŸ§¬ DNA Sequencing

Easy Java console app to work with small DNA sequences. 

## Description

This app allows you to work with DNA sequences in several ways. It has 5 working modes:

- **Clean Sequence** - removes gaps and invalid characters from a sequence.
- **Count Nucleotides** - counts A, C, T, G nucleotides in a given sequence.
- **Find Gene** - searches for a specific gene in a sequence.
- **Complementary Sequence** - generates the complementary sequence (A â†” T, C â†” G).
- **Compare Sequence** - compares two given sequences.

## Usage Example

```
Existing modes:
1. Clean the sequence.
2. Count nucleotides.
3. Find genes.
4. Get complementary sequence.
5. Compare sequences.
6. Exit.
Enter the number of the mode you need: 4
Enter the sequence: ATCAGCATATCA
Complementary sequence: TGATATGCTGAT
```

## How to Run

Compile and run a project with:
```
javac Main.java DNAMethods.java
java Main
```

## Skills practiced

* Control Flow (`switch`, `if-else`, `for-each`)
* String Methods and manipulation
* HashMap basics
* Writing clean, commented code
* Regular commits and version control
